# plex-on-the-go-infrastructure

The plex-on-the-go infrastructure project enables to start automatically the whole stack with only one command line:
docker-compose up

It will start automatically:
* the ELK stack
* Keycloak
* Plex-on-the-go backend
* Plex-on-the-go frontend

Allowing you to access it at http://localhost:4200

The project is still a WIP and will contain instruction to run it on a synology.
